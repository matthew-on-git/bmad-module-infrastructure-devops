# module-help.csv - Workflow Menu Configuration - REMOVE THESE COMMENTS
# This example file defines all workflows in your module for the BMAD Help system
#
# Columns:
# - module: Your module code (from module.yaml)
# - phase: 'anytime' OR numbered phases `1-discover 2-define 3-build 4-ship` if sequential or named phases without a number if the sequence only matters within a phase but the phase order itself is stand alone or does not matter.
# - name: Display name of the workflow
# - code: 2-letter menu code (used for quick commands like /module:code:workflow-name)
# - sequence: Order within phase (10, 20, 30...) IF ORDER MATTERS - for anytime or ordering not mattering, do not give it a sequence number
# - workflow-file: Path to workflow.yaml or workflow.md
# - command: Full command syntax (bmad:module-code:workflow-name)
# - required: true/false - whether this workflow must complete before later phases
# - agent: Agent name from agents/*.agent.yaml files
# - options: Additional workflow options (e.g., "Create Mode")
# - description: Brief description of what the workflow does
# - output-location: Variable name from module.yaml for where outputs go
# - outputs: Expected output artifact names
#
# IMPORTANT: Empty phase = anytime (universal tools work regardless of workflow state)
